# Aerodynamics
Navier-Stokes Eq. used to simulate different 6 cases of fluid flow.
The first case is: Parallel flow through a straight channel and Couette flow. 
while, the second case is: The flow between two concentric rotating cylinders. 
the third case is: The suddenly accelerated plane wall; Stokes first problem. 
Fourth case is: Flow formation in Couette motion. 
Fifth case is : Stagnation in plane (Hiemenz flow). 
sixth case is:  Flow in convergent and divergent channels.
